# The Tundra Encampment

## The Permafrost

The Tundra of Dar'kva is a vast and hostile environment. Only the Shuri nomads and occasional tribe of mountain goblins can navigate its white wastes. At night, the temperature with wind chill drops to Severe (0째F to -20째F) and Extreme (-20째F to -50째F). Equipment modifiers of +1 and +2 negate the effects of cold for Severe and Extreme temperatures respectively. Damage characters will take is listed under Cold Dangers of [Environment](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Environment).

The characters begin exhibiting the symptoms of mild hypothermia, that is, they are [fatigued](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Fatigued).

> Howling, gnashing, gutting is the wind of the Dar'kvaki tundra. The full moon reflecting off the endless snow bleaches out the stars in an endless blackened night, leaving a space so expansive both above and below as to pull at every end of your body, greedily robbing you of life-sustaining heat.
>
> Your blistered, cracked and bleeding feet track through the snow, now blue and unfeeling. Soon the blackness will set in, first in the toes, then the fingertips and hands, that is only though, if as your heart beat dwindles to a weakened murmur, you do not choose to succumb to the warm redemption of death, making your final bed upon the soft, silver powder. Since escaping your captors, it is a decision already three of the original party has made, whom you have realized only now have not been trailing behind you for some time.

**Listen, DC 12**

> From a greyed face, you barely discern:
> > "I can carry on no longer..."
>
> The man falls face first into the snow.

**Survival, DC 10**

If the party decides to carry their yet nameless, fallen comrade, within a short amount of time, those carrying him will become [exhausted](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Exhausted). Due to starvation, the unconscious man weighs about 110 lbs. See [Carrying Capacity](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/carryingCapacity.htm) for the necessary strength check based on load. Bear in mind the deductions from fatigue and exhaustion. The survival check will also indicate however, that the man cannot lie in the snow for really any amount of time before becoming unconscious, with his heart stopping shortly thereafter.

> Each step its own mortal battle, your mind has begun to reel in its own hidden space, frantically attempting to rationalize its own impending death. Bridging the gap between this life and the one after, you have begun to a hallucinate. Shadowy figures march with you across the endless expanse, rising and just as quickly evaporating in a haze of mist and shimmering northern lights. All directions have blurred into one, bathed in the light of the moon; even the hill in front of you seems haloed in a soft glow.

**Spot, DC 13**

> Something accompanies the light faintly glowing just beyond the hill: a wispy smoke. As you crest the wide embankment, a collection of leather walled yurts, lit in a welcoming orange glow, lies displayed before you.
