# The Tundra Encampment

## The Permafrost

The Tundra of Dar'kva is a vast and hostile environment. Only the Shuri nomads and occasional tribe of mountain goblins can navigate its white wastes. At night, the temperature with wind chill drops to Severe (0°F to -20°F) and Extreme (-20°F to -50°F). Equipment modifiers of +1 and +2 negate the effects of cold for Severe and Extreme temperatures respectively. Damage characters will take is listed under Cold Dangers of [Environment](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Environment).

The characters begin exhibiting the symptoms of mild hypothermia, that is, they are [fatigued](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Fatigued).

> Howling, gnashing, gutting is the wind of the Dar'kvaki tundra. The full moon reflecting off the endless snow bleaches out the stars in an endless blackened night, leaving a space so expansive both above and below as to pull at every end of your body, greedily robbing you of life-sustaining warmth.
>
> Your blistered, cracked and bleeding feet track through the snow, now blue and unfeeling. Soon blackness will set in, first in the toes, then the fingertips and hands, that is, only if as your heartbeat dwindles to a weakened murmur, you do not choose to succumb to the warm redemption of death, making your final bed upon the soft, silver powder. Since escaping your captors, it is a decision already three of the original party has made, whom you realize only now have ceased to follow for some time.

**Listen, DC 12**

> A single almost undiscernable utterance emerges from the countenance of a man beside you:
> > "I can carry on no longer..."
>
> He man falls face first into the snow.

**Survival, DC 10**

If the party decides to carry their yet nameless, fallen comrade, within a short amount of time, those carrying him will become [exhausted](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Exhausted). Due to starvation, the unconscious man weighs about 110 lbs. See [Carrying Capacity](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/carryingCapacity.htm) for the necessary strength check based on load. Bear in mind the deductions from fatigue and exhaustion. The survival check will also indicate however, that the man cannot lie in the snow for really any amount of time before becoming unconscious, with his heart stopping shortly thereafter.

> Each step its own mortal battle, your mind has begun to reel in its own hidden space, frantically attempting to rationalize its own impending death. Bridging the gap between this life and the one after, you have begun to a hallucinate. Alien, Northen Lights begin to dance amongst the backdrop of the pitch black sky, and shimmering, shadowy figures composed seemingly of the same violet lights and mist rise from the snow and march along beside you, their faces gaunt and skeletal, their eyes vacant sockets. Lost in your own growing delirium, you morbidly appreciate the appearance of these new phantasmal comrades, that fall back into the shallow frost and evaporate as quickly as they appeared, leaving some among you now musing: are these ghosts the benign spirits of the dead whose fate it is to wander the waste eternally, or are they the manifistation of my mind's own anticipated end? Too exhausted are you to verify with your fellow travelers whether or not your waking dream is communal. All directions are now blurring into one as the moonlight seems to dance cruel circles across the sky, robbing you of your sense of place, following no discernable arc with which to measure time. The very whitened hills around you seem to be haloed in a soft glow, as though either hearth or heaven were on just the other side, nevertheless, leaving salvation just out of reach.

**Spot, DC 13**

> Something accompanies the faint glow just beyond a hill: a wispy smoke. As you crest the wide embankment, a collection of leather walled yurts, lit in a welcoming orange glow, lies settled before you.

## The Shuri Encampment

**Knowledge (Local), DC 11**

The encampment below is typical of the Shuri nomads, a people indigenous to the plains and permafrost of Dar'kva. They are a proud hunting and riding culture, that while suspicious of outsiders, can be quite hospitable should they feel reason. _Shuri_ is their ethnic language, but due to their extensive hunting and trading patterns, they may additionally speak _Brostisch_ or _Dar'kvakiya_ to varying degrees.

**Spot, DC 14**

Some 100 yards opposite you, sitting upon a tall earthen pot, is the darkened figure of a man in rugged frontier furs and leather. As you step over the top of the hill, he stands slowly, his hands resting upon a shortbow.

> No choices apparent, you amble slowly down the hill.
> > Fā, dù fā shé! ~ Stop! Stop there (emphatic)!
> 
> The nomad calls out to you, his bow readied. 

[Fān Shùr Lé](https://github.com/bdrillard/campaigns/blob/master/Rhenovaar/Appendices/6%20NPCs/Fan%20Shur%20Lei.md) is initially [**Unfriendly**](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/diplomacy.htm) towards the party, eyeing them suspiciously from a distance, bow at the ready. Fān's disposition changes under the following circumstances:

* If any member of the party is ethnically Shuri or speaks _Shuri_, Fān will become immediately helpful. If any member of the party speaks _Brostisch_, they will receive a circumstantial +5 on a diplomacy check with Fān. If any member of the party addresses Fān in _Dar'kvakiya_, they will take a circumstantial -3 on a diplomacy check with Fān.
* Upon seeing the dire condition of the party, Fān will become **Friendly**, seeing them to be no distinct threat and in need of serious aid.
* If any member of the party has chosen to carry the incapacitated man, the party will receive a circumstantial +15 to a diplomacy check when asking for help.
* If any member of the party attempts subterfuge (moving silently, hiding along the embankment, etc), and Fān discovers this, he will revert to **Unfriendly**.

If Fān is at least **Indifferent**, he will allow the party to enter the camp to seek provisions. If Fān is at least **Friendly**, his demeanor will be more hospitable, and will offer the party food and better clothing.

**Friendly**:

> His bow lowers, and a smile accompanying a look of concern spreads over the young man's face. Such renewed hope reinvigorates your body, that you nearly fall over your own feet as you approach his outstretched hand. 
> > Pā, pā shé! ~ Come, come (emphatic)!
>
> You follow the young nomad through to the center of the camp, where a sizable bonfire illuminates a collection of seven or so hide and textile-walled yurts. Such is your fever that you, however, can hardly see. Instead, there are the whispy movements of the village denizens, moving to-and-fro amongst the tents, the vague outlines of people sitting upon low stools, you assume, peering at you, the smoke of long pipes rising from beside their faces. The pale whites of the steppe that dominated your peripheral vision have given way to welcoming tans and oranges, reds and yellows. Your breathing grows erratic, your heartbeats irregular. Finally, after the sum total of the struggle, your fear here on the precipice of your own survival, you will simply collapse and slip into death of your own exhaustion. You begin to lean forward, your torso now completely unable to support your frame, your arms outstretched looking for some form of support but only groping at the empty air, when suddenly you discern only the precipitous shift in your center of gravity as you begin to fall, and concerned voices rise around you, and these voices rush to you, and you are caught; and you are lifted; and you are carried into a space so warmly lit as to appear to you as being submerged in a pool of morning sunlight; and this light fills your lungs as much as your eyes, and you experience a kind of drowning, but with a liquid you feel somehow you know you can breath, and this drowning does not cause you fear, rather, it feels instead like a kind of distant, peaceful memory; a memory that assures you of your own safety, and that now embraces you in a deep, welcoming slumber. You fall unconscious, sensing lastly several primordial forms, seated upon the floor, holding watch beside you.
