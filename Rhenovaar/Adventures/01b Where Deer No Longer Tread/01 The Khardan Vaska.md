# The Khardan Vaaska

## The Permafrost

The Tundra of Dar'kva is a vast and hostile environment. Only the Shuri nomads and occasional tribe of mountain goblins can navigate its white wastes. At night, the temperature with wind chill drops to Severe (0°F to -20°F) and Extreme (-20°F to -50°F). Equipment modifiers of +1 and +2 negate the effects of cold for Severe and Extreme temperatures respectively. Damage characters will take is listed under Cold Dangers of [Environment](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Environment).

The characters begin exhibiting the symptoms of mild hypothermia, that is, they are [fatigued](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Fatigued).

> Howling, gnashing, gutting is the wind of the Dar'kvaki tundra. The full moon reflecting off the endless snow bleaches out the stars in an endless blackened night, leaving a space so expansive both above and below as to pull at every end of your body, greedily robbing you of life-sustaining warmth.
>
> Your blistered, cracked and bleeding feet track through the snow, now blue and unfeeling. Soon blackness will set in, first in the toes, then the fingertips and hands, that is, only if as your heartbeat dwindles to a weakened murmur, you do not choose to succumb to the warm redemption of a final sleep, making your bed upon the soft, silver powder.
>
> Refugees and deserters crossing the plains of the Khardan Vaska have become as common as the once-great roaming herds of taiga deer. Perhaps you were amongst the inhabitants of the hamlets and villages set ablaze in the constant exchange territory, or perhaps you were once amongst the brigades that carried out such orders. One way or another, your previous life is far behind you now, and indeed, the end of your current one may be closing in.
>
> The permafrost carries on in all directions. A full moon drowns out any sense of space provided by the stars. Ëndúinlar, the northern star, has been doused by the near blinding light of the moon reflecting off the snow. Long ago, in your mounting delirium, your slipping sense of time rendered it impossible to navigate by the passage of the moon. Has it passed its zenith, or is it in approach? Does running to its embrace lead you south, or does it instead beckon you to an icy, northerly grave?
>
> Each step has become its own mortal battle. In an attempt to mediate its own demise, your mind reels in a space it projects onto your surroundings. Bridging the gap between this life and the next, you have begun to perceive strange and ephemeral visions in your peripherals. Shadowy figures composed of whisping snow crystal and shimmering violet-green lights swirl up and march beside you, their faces gaunt and skeletal, their eyes vacant sockets. Silently, you wonder if these phantasms are the ghosts of those who fell to the waste, or if their presence is simply your own maddened invention. Their presence gives you a macabre comfort, and you feel for once the warmth of comraderie well up inside you, but you remember, one always feels warm before one freezes to death, a fate which has already befallen three of your original party.

**Listen, DC 12**

> A single almost undiscernable utterance emerges from the countenance of a man beside you:
> > "I can carry on no longer..."
>
> He man falls face first into the snow.

**Survival, DC 10**

If the party decides to carry their yet nameless, fallen comrade, within a short amount of time, those carrying him will become [exhausted](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Exhausted). Due to starvation, the unconscious man weighs about 110 lbs. See [Carrying Capacity](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/carryingCapacity.htm) for the necessary strength check based on load. Bear in mind the deductions from fatigue and exhaustion. The survival check will also indicate however, that the man cannot lie in the snow for really any amount of time before becoming unconscious, with his heart stopping shortly thereafter.

At this juncture, the PCs should roll for 1d6 points of subdual damage.

## The Frozen Lake

**Spot, DC 10**

> Having walked in some direction for some time, you fear the unsure footing of your failing body may have simply pulled you in wide, drawn-out circles. In this wandering with no dawn, it only now dawns on you that perhaps you have already died, your body cast aside in the thin snow long ago, but your spirit carrying on, in a night as endless as it is expansive. This totalizing fear, however, is at once dismissed. You see in the distance, maybe some 200 yards away, a faint, ashy-grey smoke tumbling upwards, apparently across the crest of a hill at the end of a long, narrow valley.

**Spot, DC 13**

> Partially uncovered by the sweeping winds, you see before you, a great sheet of ice, circumscribed by the valley. The tracks of a horse make their way across its length.

The Frozen Lake makes the lair of a (Frostgeist)[https://github.com/bdrillard/campaigns/blob/master/Rhenovaar/Appendices/7%20Creatures/Geist.md#frostgeist], the shadow of the soul of a tracker that was entombed beneath the ice. The Frostgeist will utilize its spell-like abilities to attract the PCs to the source of its original demise near the middle of the lake, a location from which it is incapable of leaving. If necessary, the geist will lure the players towards it by making it appear and sound as if the ice is cracking from the _edges_ inward as opposed to from the center outward.

**Listen, DC 10**

> The grey-blue surface buckles and groans against itself, with low pitches emenating from its unfathomable depths, rising to high, short squeals riding along the spreading cracks. The wind swirls the thin white powder in a cyclone upwards where then, to your astonishment and horror, a phantasmal figure composed of a thick translucent mist materializes from the snow and spontaneously manifested arcs of black, violet light. Unfolding its body in the air just above the surface of the lake, it elongates to an upright position, its gaunt face bent long and agonized, its eyes black, empty sockets, its mouth contorted in a haunting scream that reverberates to the very core of your soul, threatening to shatter you sanity like a crystaline glass.

**Spot, DC 13** 

> The wind having swept the thin snow away, it appears the apparition rose from a darkened form just beneath the ice, which appears human in shape and size.

The players are currently no match for the Frostgeist, which will first attempt to disable them with its _Frightful Moan_, before flying over them, hemming them farther into the interior of the lake. If the players approach within 10 feet of the Frostgeist's corpse break through the ice (as though it were a [Camouflaged Pit Trap](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Traps#Camouflaged_Pit_Trap), and must succeed a DC 20 Reflex save to avoid falling into the frigid, bone-chilling water. Falling in the water necessitates an immediate roll to resist the effects of cold exposure see (Cold Dangers of [Environment](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Environment))

The geist will continue its attacks until the entire party is unconscious.

### Non-linearity

The players may return to the site of the Frozen Lake to seek retribution against the Frostgeist. With a successful search (DC 20), they will discover several additional bodies beneath the ice. Exhuming them will prove difficult. Some means of breaking the ice and dredging up the remains without risking exposure will need to be devised, but a simple potion of [Resist Energy](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Resist_elements) would likely best do the trick.

Treasure is the following:
* _The Hobgoblin_: Short Sword (rusted), Hide Armor (fetid), pouch with 52gp
* _The Sell-sword_: 1 100gp amethyst, Chain Shirt (rusted), 1 Longsword (rusted), 1 Buckler (rotted), 1 Backpack (threadbare) with 63gp
* _The Tracker_: 1 50gp bloodstone, 1 Longbow (rotted), 1 Dagger (rusted), 1 Backpack (tattered) with 85gp, +1 Studded Leather
