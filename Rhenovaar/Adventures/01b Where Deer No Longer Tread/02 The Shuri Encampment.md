# The Shuri Encampment

## Coming Round

> As you open your eyes, your field of vision filled with blurred orange, tans, and yellows. You are incapable of any movement, you can't even determine what position your body is in. You feel you must be somehow suspended, weightless. Humanoid shapes of composed of silhouettes drift in and out of sight. Pink noise finally comes into focus, the sound of cracking embers and flame, a knife against a wooden board, and then a voice:
> > Xān lé wé ~ They wake (presently)
>
> Sitting upon his knees, you at last you make out the form of a young man, dressed in deer leather and forest-green wools. He leans in closer and studies your finger-tips and toes.
> > Pʰī ló ~ (They are) lucky
>
> He begins to speak in Brosti
> > You are very lucky. All the blackness has left your limbs.
>  
> You appear to have woken in a large, round, tent-like structure. Its wall is formed by leather covered cross-hatched wooden struts, and its ceiling is a shallowly sloped cone. The floor is covered with furs and carpets, in the center is a cast-iron buck stove. The young man's eyes are the shape of half-almond slices, rendered all the more thin by his current broad smile. Near the stove, an elderly women in a colorfully embroidered red woolen tunic prepares something using a morter and pestel, drawing from a collection of herbs and jarred ingredients set on various placemats around her feet. A cricket with unusually long flitting antenae almost seems to study her movements intently. Using her thin limbs, she lifts a large kettle from the stove and poors boiling water through a strainer of the ground slurry into ceramic cups. Edging upon her knees, she approaches you with the drought, and beckons you drink. In encouragement, she tilts the cup, forcing you to imbibe more quickly, and perhaps also keeping you from instantly spitting it out. She then places her thumb and index finger on your forehead and whispers inaudibly.

All Ability Score damage of the players is restored as though subject to a potion of [Lesser Restoration](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Lesser_restoration).

> The young man asks,
> > You can stand? 
>
> To your surprise, you can.
>
> You find yourself similarly dressed as your hosts. In thick wools, and in fur-trimmed leather shoes. The young man waits for you by the hut's door. The old woman, still sitting upon her legs, smiles broadly, her face like a wizened peach pit, and nods at you as she begins to puff from a long pipe. The cricket chirps.

**Spot, DC 13**

A young girl peers from underneath a pile of furs. Her eyes are inquisitive and skeptical. She must have been watching for much of the time.

## The Shuri Village

> You step out to the early-evening of the Khardan Vaska. Somewhere in the West, the sun sets on the horizon behind a curtain of cloud-cover. The low ceiling of the sky stretches out as far as the scrubby brown grasses. Now with sound mind and in daylight, you perceive how vast the Vaska truly is. As you look out just beyond the village, you can see for miles and miles, out to wide plains and rolling hills, a desolate and indomitable landscape of sepia and shadow-covered frost. It strikes you unlikely that anyone could possibly live in this place.
>
> Given the lonesome environment, the very existence of this village is astonishing to you. The Shuri are a simple, but proud herding folk from a long, nomadic, horse-mounted tradition. For centuries their various clans have made the Vaska their near-boundless home, following enormous groups of reindeer and grazing their own furry oxen. Their villages are composed of a cluster of yurts, each holding at least one full nuclear family, as well as paternal grandparents, and sometimes some extended relatives. Shuri homes are walled with rugged leather, and supported by wooden lattices. Their interiors are often richly decorated with Shuri handiwork: colorful embroidery and detailed carvings.
>
> The bleakness of the Vaska has made the Shuri experts of optimistic thinking. Amidst the long, winter season, they faithfully tend their animals, and await the coming of the Summer to the Vaska, when the plains fill with wildflowers from which they craft their vibrant dyes, and they move their camps to the southern end of the Vaska where they reunite with their more distant kin of the other greant clans, and they trade their wares for those few things that the plains itself cannot supply.

[Fān Shùr Lé](https://github.com/bdrillard/campaigns/blob/master/Rhenovaar/Appendices/6%20NPCs/Fan%20Shur%20Lei.md) will introduce himself and the provide some background into the Shuri people and their nomadic lifestyle. He will explain that while he and several other Lei Shuri had been tracking an escaped reindeer, they came upon the valley of the Frostgeist (Fān will call the creature a Pō Fùŋ). They succeeded in dispersing the geist and bringing you back to the village, each very nearly dead, where you were cared for by the Adept, [Maī Bā](https://github.com/bdrillard/campaigns/blob/master/Rhenovaar/Appendices/6%20NPCs/Mai%20Ba%20Shur%20Lei.md) for three days.

Fān will indicate to [Hilda Hewnstone](https://github.com/bdrillard/campaigns/blob/master/Rhenovaar/Appendices/6%20NPCs/Hilda%20Hewnstone.md) for some provisions, as well as to [Feliks Czesław](https://github.com/bdrillard/campaigns/blob/master/Rhenovaar/Appendices/6%20NPCs/Feliks%20Czeslaw.md), the wandering Łödzisch wizard.
