# Entering Brynn

## The Approach

> You trudge through the water on towards the village. With every step beneath the opaque water, you feel your boots sucking into the mud, as though the very ground were clawing at you. The flood has risen up to your shins now, and you wonder, how could it not have somewhere else to flow in country so flat? As you get closer towards the village, the trees seem somehow more sunken. As you continue to walk on a surface submerged, you look at a landscape where only the upper limbs reach out from the water, their branches gnarled and twisted like broken fingers. 
>
> Brynn would have been an unassuming agrarian village, a hamlet really, home to less than two dozen people. It lies in front of you, sitting atop a wide, low hill, seemingly desaturated, appearing to you in a state of decay, as though your vision were flecked with mud. This is the kind of village you had heard about. The kind that disappear. 

**Spot, DC 14** 

A hobgoblin stands looking out from a watch tower at the entrance of the village.

## Encounter, Building 2

> This building looks like the home of the village smithy. A horrific stench envelopes this place, but all the furniture is conspicuously still in place.
>
> The smith has been affixed to his bedroom wall, limbs outstretched, held in place by chunks of iron bar, nails, and tools. A shovel is embedded through his chest, lodged into the boards of the wall.
