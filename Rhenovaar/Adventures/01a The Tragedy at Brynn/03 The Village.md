# The Village

## The Village Center

> The center of Brynn is a mire ringed by a half-dozen buildings. Water encroaches above the thresholds, seeping over the floorboards. The windows are broken or darkened with soot, the roofs charred or caved in.

## Encounter, Building 3

> This is a simple one-room farmhouse. There is a back door leading to a small plot in the northeastern corner. 

**Spot DC, 13**

> Walking out beyond the the farmplot are two hobgoblins.

**Spot, DC 13** 

> The long handle of a hoe rises at an angle from the ground. The haft is splintered towards the top. The blade of the hoe is embedded in a human back. Upon inspection, you see that the right temple of the skull is shattered.

## Building 4

> This building is set apart from the rest. In the distance, some two dozen yards down, the door to the house is open ajar to a black void. The path seems to slowly elongate the longer you look just inside the open doorway.
>
> This one room farmhouse looks as though a whirlwind of blunted sheers had blown through. The walls are inset with deep, splintered gashes; there are knives stuck in the floorboards. In the middle of the single room is a square hole, an opening into a sort of root-cellar, missing its trapdoor. 

**Search, DC 14**

> You notice at the edges of the floorboards at the door to the cellar, there are numerous holes in the wood. Amongst the clutter of the room, you begin to find several large iron nails.

> There's a steep staircase that leads down inside. Along the earthen walls are shelves of broken jars. The space is dark. From atop, you cannot see to the back of it without entering.

**Search, DC 10**

> The space is frigid and damp. The shelf walls seem to angle upwards, imparting a distinct, claustrophobic feeling. In the back of the cellar, amongst broken shards of glass, mud, and splinters, you see the glint of something small, with a golden luster. 
>
> It is a locket. On the back you can see signs of wear, as though it had been rubbed often in ones palm. Inside is the same tintype photograph held by Ardin.

While emerging from the staircase, **Spot, DC 10**

> As you ascend the staircase back to the single room, you notice in the underside of the floorboards, bloodied scratches in the wood, as though gouged by claws. 

**Spot, DC 13**

> Something moves past the eastern window, the form of a figure, bent over. The sound of its movements against the mud outside is alarmingly quick.

**Survival, DC 13**

> You might say, unnaturally quick.

## Encounter, Building 4, Barn

> Behind the house is a small plot of farm land. In the southeast corner, there's a barn with half its roof caved in.

**Spot DC, Hide**

Inside the barn, northwest corner, there's a pit hazard, **Spot, DC 14**

Hiding amongst the wet hay are 4 [dire rats](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Dire_Rat)

## Encounter, Building 5

> This home is in a similar state of total disarray. In the southern half of the eastern wall there's a doorway to a kitchen, and in the northern half is an open door.
>
> The back wall of the kitchen is partially burned through. Wet and moulding foodstuffs are on the counter: bread, cheese, a dull knife. 

**Listen, DC 15**

> You can hear movement down the stairs.

> The door opens to a set of steep steps. At the base of the stare case is another open doorway, leading into a cellar.

Secret door, **Search, DC 20**

> Shelves holding jarred vegetables and preserved meats can apparently be removed. A fetid smell coming from behind the wooden boards leads you to believe they can be removed to behind them to reveal a hidden cupboard. Inside is a bizarre collection of items. Jars containing bizarre oils, some of them with just dirt. There are dried herbs, bones, and hanging by its tail, on a nail in the wall, is a gutted black cat. Of interest to you are a few glass bottles.

## Encounter, Building 6

> This home is by far the most expensive. Out of all the houses in the village, besides the inn, this is the only one with stake roofs, while all the others have been thatch. While the other simple houses had only wooden rods and shudders, this one has glass panes. It's curtains are thick, made of a heavy, purple velvet. Cupboards and drawers have all been pulled out. Shards of ceramic and broken glass litter the floor. There'
