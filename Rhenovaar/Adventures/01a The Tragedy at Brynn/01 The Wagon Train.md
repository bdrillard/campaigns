# The Wagon Train

> You cannot remember when last it had not been raining. The very sky seems to have descended, as a ceiling of grey rain clouds that stretch from horizon to horizon. Floodwaters have rendered the landscape now unrecognizable. Where there were once tall, green grasses, there are now only the ripples of raindrops across an infinite mire, and the water only relentlessly rises. The few trees occasionally visible through the back of the wagon stand bare and lifeless, as though their very roots had been starved and drowned.
