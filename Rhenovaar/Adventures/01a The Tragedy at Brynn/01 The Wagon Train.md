# The Wagon Train

## Forward

> You cannot remember when last it had not been raining. The very sky seems to have descended, as a ceiling of grey rain clouds that stretch from horizon to horizon. Floodwaters have rendered the landscape now unrecognizable. Where there were once tall, green grasses, there are now only the ripples of raindrops across an infinite mire, and the water relentlessly rises. The few trees occasionally visible through the back of the wagon stand bare and lifeless, as though their very roots had been drowned. 
>
> The northeastern plains of Brost were once a plentiful place, where the farmers had grown wheat and vegetables. It seemed the war came without reason. No clear dispute, no palace intrigue or assassination. For most, it simply occurred that after months of calls to defend the borders, troops from all sides began to move across them. A long string of grievances between 6 human nations smouldered for a time until something of a stray wind raised them to conflagration. Frontier villages emptied, over the years, fronts shifted, whole families were buried, and whether or not any given place on a map still existed became suspect. 
>
> Everyone is a refugee here. The discarded and displaced loaded into wagons when they could, or began to walk behind them. Reports indicate Darkvaki legions yet again on the move from the north. Greyed hands clutch last possessions, greyed faces look downcast from under hoods. A wetness has crept into every space, robbing the body of warmth, all despite the near two dozen of people loaded into this one covered wagon, leading you to morbidly wonder if the person sitting next to you is as cold as the ambient air because they are already dead. 
>
> Only one person appears to show any modicum of vitality. A man sitting close to the open back of the wagon, looking out to the receding horizon. If your memory serves, he would have boarded the train at Kölditz, the fortifications of the Pröskur 5th Cavalry and 6th and 7th Infantries. He wears armor of leather platelettes and chainmail, under one arm is a simple bag. His body is turned at an angle such that you cannot see his face from under his Brostische helmet, the Royal Horned Owl in brass across its black smoked front. His right hand is outstretched, into the open air, catching raindrops. You notice a gold trinket in his hands, a small locket. 
>
> As though perceiving your curiosity, he turns to you. It is a that moment you notice the bandage. A white cloth covers his eyes, with scar tissue visible at the edes. Although unable to meet your eyes, he smiles at you, his face is warm but worn, simultaneously youthful and aged. 

Ardin Willowbraid served in the Pröskur 5th Cavalry. He was blinded when caught in the fire blast of a Darkvaki Tsorzevar, his mount, incinerated. He was the sole survivor of his regiment. Now that the war, at least in some sense, is over for him, he is returning to his village to resume his life as a simple subsistence farmer, but more importantly, he returns to his wife, Ellena, and young son, who would have been just born shortly before the time he was conscripted.

> His locket holds a tintype photo, a younger man, hopeful, contented, with light whiskers seated, and behind him, holding a young baby, a woman of remarkable grace, slender features, and dark, raven hair.

His village, Brynn, should be close now. 

> An arrow shoots through the canvas of the wagon.

## Afterward

> Towards the distance in the east, you see smoke arising from a cluster of buildings.

When Ardin is told of smouldering village, he will implore the PCs to investigate for him. Given his blindness, he says he will wait for the players to bring him his wife and child near a tree on the outskirts of the village.
