# The Axeman

> I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'!

The Axeman is a poltergeist who haunts a forest near the logging community of Holzrand, a hamlet outside Centraal. For the last few years the townspeople have had to travel significant distances in order to avoid the haunt of the geist.

It would behoove the players to ask locals about the nature of the Axeman's manifestation:
**Gather Information**
* **DC 12**: Town folk suspect the Axeman to be the malevolent spirit of Herrman Friessen, a local pariah who was banished to the outlying forest after having stabbed a traveling merchant in the hand over a lost card game. A logging party of three encountered a lone man in a blighted grove who butchered two of them with a felling axe.
* **DC 16**: A shameful secret of the village is that Friessen actually had a wife and young child. When Herrman moved to the town, her married the eldest daughter of a local subsistence farmer. Friessen slowly revealed himself afterwards as a fiend, and jealously prohibited either his wife or child from interacting with the other villagers. Friessen took the two with him when he left for the inner woods. The woman's name was Henrietta Adel, and the child's name was Bertrand. Chronologically, this occurred 16 years ago. 
* **DC 20**: Two local children traveled out into the inner wood unaccompanied. Only one has returned and has since been mute. While asleep he convulses as though having terrible nightmares.

## Abel Lünden

Abel Lünden (7 years old) and his little brother Cyril (5 years old), were the two children who ventured to the inner wood. If the players can convince the family to let them observe the child while he sleeps, they may attempt a Dream Scry, in which they will see Abel repeatedly revisits the disappearance of his brother:

> You see a small boy running in front of you along a forest path. He's apparently chasing after another boy of similar age who is similarly running ahead, but from within the underbrush. The leading boy always seems obscurred by shadow and folliage, yet none of the saplings or ferns seem to slow his pace. 
>
> You follow the leading boy for some distance through several turns and eventually reach grove. The strange boy you had been following runs into a small shack towards the back of the grove. Twilight has come to the wood and the sun seems to be setting unusually fast. Your companion has followed up to the door frame while you stand back. As he approaches the darkness of the portal, in the way suddenly appears the tall and foreboding figure of a man, looming well over six feet tall. His eyes are obscurred by the brim of a wide hat with a buckle in the center. At the man's side he holds a feller's axe. With his other hand, he reaches down and grabs the young boy by the front of his shirt, looks up at you, smiling with sinister eyes, and then vanishes along with the child in a spiralling blur. The grove now vacant, you take a reflexive step back, then turn and flee as a disembodied scream suddenly fills the space, the sound of hacking echoing all along the path home, all your cries caught in your throat.

**Spellcraft, DC 20**: the entity has apparently plane-shifted with the child.

## Encounter

The Axeman can be found easily enough by a forest path leading deeper to the inner wood. Near twilight one can begin to hear the sound of an axe cutting into wood. As one nears the grove of the Axeman's home after dark, close inspections of the trees leads one to discover that they slowly ooze blood from their knotholes. 

The Axeman will encounter the players in the middle from the grove, emerging from the small shack which makes his home. He will fight the players using his special attacks and his keen, ghost touch feller's axe. When near defeat, he will attempt to flee to his demi-plane, but with one of the players, as with his plane-shift special ability.
