# Along the Run

> A low mist rises off the Waal and meanders its way into the streets of lower Riverbottom. Suffused with city sewage, and the collective sins of itinerant sailors, the fog of the Riverbottom Run subtley chokes and sickens all those whom it envelopes. Even the stench of death is nothing novel when caught on the rising winds, rather, you are stopped by the smell of Catchfoot smouldering in an adjacent alley, and then by the momentary glow of a tindertwig struck just down the way, its striker remaining yet obscured by the mist.
