# Along the Run

> A low mist rises off the Waal and meanders its way into the streets of lower Riverbottom. Suffused with city sewage, and the collective sins of itinerant sailors, the fog of the Riverbottom Run subtley chokes and sickens all those whom it envelopes. But on this particular evening, a bizarre cross-wind emerges from a nearby ally. Something thicker travels among the fog, it smells of visceral, it reeks of death.

**Spot, DC 15**

> The alleyways of Centraal's oldest and most neglected districts are constricting and meandering. The buildings lean over their thoroughfares in such a way that as for the thinnest of them, the sun never strikes the street. Some thirty feet down the alley a glimmer of moonlight diffuses in the mist from between the eaves, illuminating a limp and lifeless form sprawled upon cobblestones.

Upon approaching the body:

> Cracks in the stone have formed channels for viscous, ruby rivulettes. From the radially splayed body, blood flows in straight lines and right turns, forming a grotesque arabesque. With its limbs shattered, hands dislocated, and spine cracked at an obscene angle, this body of a woman is nigh unrecognizable as human. The jugular is now more of a crater, and the face is canyoned with deep, haphazard lacerations. 

> Even the stench of death is nothing novel when caught on the rising winds, rather, you are stopped by the smell of Catchfoot smouldering in an adjacent alley, and then by the momentary glow of a tindertwig struck just down the way, its striker remaining yet obscured by the mist.

**Listen, DC 8**

If the PCs attempt to move silently, [Shepherd](https://github.com/bdrillard/campaigns/blob/master/Rhenovaar/Appendices/6%20NPCs/Shepherd%20Knightly.md) and [Abrahm](https://github.com/bdrillard/campaigns/blob/master/Rhenovaar/Appendices/6%20NPCs/Abrahm%20Daksh.md) will attempt a listen. Should the PCs remain hidden, the two peacekeepers will continue their investigation, otherwise Abrahm will demand sternly:

> Wie gaats daar?

It is always best not to stalk a law keeper. If the PCs attempted subterfuge and failed (such as a poor Move Silently), [diplomacy](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/diplomacy.htm) will be necessary, as Abrahm and Shepherd's initial attitude will be unfriendly. Otherwise they will begin as indifferent. Unless Abrahm and Shepherd are made friendly, Abrahm will suggest the party leave the crime scene. If the party fails the initial diplomacy, Shepherd will cast Mage Armor on Abrahm, and Abrahm will make moves to extricate the party from the scene. At that point, more imaginative role-playing will be required.
