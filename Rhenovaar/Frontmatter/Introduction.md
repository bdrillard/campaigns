# Introduction

## Purpose

Rhenovaar is a thematic campaign setting that aims, through a series of episodic adventures, to invite the PCs to personally engage with the world around them. Dungeons and Dragons is a powerful and unique tool for storytelling in that, even when compared to other mediums, it provides the greatest freedom to its players, but more importantly, the engagement between the players and their story due to this apparent freedom can be exceedingly visceral. Rhenovaar seeks to place its characters in situations where their subjectivity matters.

## Structure

The world of Rhenovaar is presented through a series of vignettes, or episodes. Each one of these episodes is meant to be a self-contained story that can be completed in a single dedicated session, perhaps two. The 3.5 system is used as the scaffolding upon which Rhenovaar is built, however, liberties are taken to keep players interested. Techniques for maintaining pace and interest include a milestone experience system, that is, the end of each episode should result in leveling-up whether by means of both encounter experience, and awards based on NPC interaction.

## Rules

In order to force the PCs into certain more realistic (or perhaps more fatalistic) situations, rules in Rhenovaar matter. The following rules and themes hold:

* Strict Economic Control - PCs can only by what is explicitly provided in a local economy.
* Spell Renewal - a full period of uninterrupted rest is mandatory for all classes and races in order for spells to be regained for the next day. In addition, if any ritual applies, it must be performed at its appointed time, e.g. Clerics of Pelor must pray for their spells at dawn after an evening of full rest. If they fail to rest, or they fail to pray at the appropriate time, they must work with whatever spells remain from the previous day.
* Weight and Ammo - PCs cannot simply carry an inordinate amount of goods, and they can exhaust their ammo. Finding (or even more unlikely, buying) a [Portable Hole](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Portable_Hole) should be cause for great celebration. A ranger who can craft arrows is an asset.
* Memorization Won't Save You - Many encounters will use monsters described in the Monster Manuals only as templates, otherwise, their descriptions will often be wholly unique.
* Things Can Kill You - for variety, side-quests are included in each episode. Side-quests are strictly non-linear and can feature encounters that are simply overpowering. For dramatic effect, even main-quest encounters may be deliberately lethal, in order to survive, players must utilize other means than simple hack-and-slash.
* Dying is Tough - the only spell for restoring life is [Raise Dead](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Raise_Dead), and now requires a Caster Level of seven. Also, the casting time is a full-day, has the material component of [True Resurrection](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:True_Resurrection), and the casting must be wholly uninterrupted. If casting fails, the body dematerializes, and the spell cannot be reattempted. Resurrection and True Resurrection are eliminated. Wish and Miracle likewise can only perform Raise Dead. Some forms of death may be even more punitive.
* Skills Are Important - invest in them, diversify them. They will often be what saves you.
* Gnomes are Forbidden - relations among the races and the histories between them form a crucial component of the Rhenovaar. Gnomes are not a playable race for the PCs.
* Alignment is Fuzzy - alignment as defined by the coordinate system of Good and Evil, Lawful and Chaotic, has been normalized. Spells such as (Protection from Evil)[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Protection_from_Evil] or (Undetectable Alignment)[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Undetectable_Alignment] operate purely on an Us-vs-Them basis, that is, _your_ party is protected from _their_ attacks, or _your_ intentions become inscrutable to _their_ divination. Everyone operates within factions; events may prove that _they_ are good and _you_ are evil, for whatever those terms are actually worth. Certainly demons and angels are elements of Rhenovaar, but the point is that the players should be able to consider whether a Faustian bargain with powerful devil was actually justifiable, or whether a judgemental planar cleansing is reconcilable with good.
* Flexibility - plenty is still up for interpretation. Can a PC make a compelling argument as to why the threat range of a lightning bolt goes from linear to semi-spherical in a body of water? That sounds pretty neat, go for it.
