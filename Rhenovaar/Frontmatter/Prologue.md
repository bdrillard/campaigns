## A Continent Forsaken

The primary, uniting feature of Rhenovaarian history for the last 17 years is unrelenting warfare. The continent of Rhenovaar is divided above and below between the empires of humans, the forested enclaves of elves, the isolated dominion of the gnomes, the carved halls of the dwarven clans, and all the disparate peoples over whom others claim lordship. Ambition and excess drove the continent into totalizing war those many years ago, and it is ambition and excess that sustains it. Once bountiful and hospitable, the landscape of Rhenovaar is now pitted with craters and desaturated by blight. The magic that once delighted children on the street is now employed to sustain the armaments of a sleepless war machine. Even the prayers of the cleric have become now a pithy forward to another slaughter. By the devices of mortal races, the very earth now heaves and splits, by the wave of hands whole forests are burned, and by the cover of darkness, a new malice claims those who would find rest.

## Deep Roots

The current state of Rhenovaar is naturally the result of a long and complicated history, that will be illuminated through dialogue, battle, and discovery.
