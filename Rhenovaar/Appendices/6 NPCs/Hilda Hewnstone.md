## Description

Hilda Highwind, or Dǔr Gí as the Shuri refer to her, is a traveling merchant of formidable strength and character. During peacetime, she traveled freely between Brost and Dar'kva, bringing supplies to barter with the Shuri. These days, however, with borders heavily patrolled, her services straddle the line between free commerce and clandestine smuggling. Among the Shuri, she has built up a quite a reputation as a conveyor of much needed supplies, and for this reason, they conferred to her the title Dǔr Gí, which means "a rock marking a place", a very specific Shuri phrase describing a glacier-deposited boulder used as a landmark, and itself a cultural metaphor for trustworthiness and dependability. Hewnstone is a poor Brostische translation, but one she has taken on with pride as her new surname, a testament of her friendship with a proud and loyal people.

Like all frontier folk, Hilda is initially skeptical of strangers, save reason to be otherwise. When on her good side, however, one can expect fine wares, and filling (although perhaps not especially tasty) food. If Hilda Hewnstone is amiable to the party by means of deed or [Diplomacy](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Diplomacy), she will sell goods at base listed price (as opposed to the situational markups to which the PCs will grow accustomed). She may even be open to discounts in the form of free items if the PCs really stock up.
