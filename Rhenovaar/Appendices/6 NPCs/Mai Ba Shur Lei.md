## Description

Maī Bā Shùr Lé is great aunt of [Fān Shùr Lé](https://github.com/bdrillard/campaigns/blob/master/Rhenovaar/Appendices/6%20NPCs/Fan%20Shur%20Lei.md) and adept of the Lei Shuri. Her tremendous age (seventy-three) is even more outmatched by her capabilities as a healer and protector, although she may not be as spry as she once was. A poor translation of Maī Bā is simply, "old woman", but the words alone never carry the same expressions of sincere deference and respect with which the Lei Shuri address her. Maī Bā's has a young Shuri apprentice, Tī Shùr Lé, and her familiar is a cricket named Tō Lò. Her cricket grants her a +3 bonus on Survival checks and has the same stats as a [weasel](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Weasel), but lacks any attack.
