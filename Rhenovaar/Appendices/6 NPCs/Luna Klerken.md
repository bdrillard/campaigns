## Description

Luna Klerken is a Brosti Special Detective, but her similarities to any other member of the Peacekeepers really end there. Since her childhood, Luna exhibited an especially precocious talent for knowing certain things that the adults around her would insist must be unknowable to a child. She remarked in front of her grandmother, for example, that a particular chair was the favorite of her deceased grandfather, despite never actually having known him. Her somewhat morbid fascination with the dead distanced her from her still living peers, but this alienation allowed her to all the more doggedly hone her skills as a diviner. 

After ascending to Centraal's esteemed Academae Arcanix, she excelled in the arts of the Seer, and was even an accomplished arcane researcher, publishing _On the Use of Trauma Stones as Foci_ and _The Evidentiality Particles of Sorsevari and Usages in Clairvoyant Incantations_. Her primary desire, however, was to ply her skills in divination of recent events. For this reason, she joined the Brosti Peacekeepers, and garnered for herself a reputation for uncovering promising leads even when much of the evidence had been rendered irrecoverable. She appears to find her fame somewhat a nuisance, as prideful detectives will often keep pieces of evidence from her, robbing her of the personal effects that act as much-needed foci during a clairvoyant session, and the Brosti Military Police are constantly putting pressure on the Peacekeeper Chief to transfer her command.

Luna is always recognizable by the Brosti Peacekeeper patch sewn on the left shoulder of her otherwise unremarkable blue Adept's robes, as well as the heavy and constant odor of censer smoke. Her demeanor is detached and single-minded. When forced to interact with others, she will usually designate a single person with whom she will speak exclusively, and even then either only in curt phrases, or extemporaneous information-packed monologues which one couldn't possibly grasp in one hearing. Only with Abrahm and Shepherd does she invariably answer a call to assist, and does she show even the slightest hint of a sense of perverse humor. Having considerable reason to doubt the existence of free will, _she thinks the implications of nondeterminism are really rather funny_.

Luna specializes in Divination, with Necromancy and Evocation being her forbidden schools.
