## Description

Feliks Czesław is a Łödzisch traveling wizard. As Dar'kva has closed its borders, even to neutral Łödz, Feliks is attempting to make his way back home, heading southeast. He will explain basic information about Łödz, in a considerate manner, should the party inquire. Mostly, however, he is interested in comparing spell books. Should the party include a wizard, he will act as though friendly, and will allow the caster to trade spells not in the others books, and will also offer to sell a scroll or two, otherwise he remains roughly indifferent. Should the party contain a sorcerer, he will be fascinated to even see one alive, as he knows that throughout the belligerent empires, sorcerers are frequently the subjects of internment or pogroms. As Łödz is comparably far more tolerant to _spontaneous casters_, Feliks himself is similarly peaceable.

Feliks wears clothing traditional to wizards of Łödz, a thick, blue ankle length coat, that widens outward slightly past the hips, with long, slender sleeves that open at the cuff. A run of black braids tie the coat down the chest, and along the circumference of the hips are deep, cylindrical pockets for holding scroll cases. He wears a grey, cylindrical woolen cap, with a blue rectangle of felt stitched along the front.

His familiar is a Crow, Czesaré. Crow's possess the same stats as [Ravens](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Raven), and provide a +2 to Fortitude saves. Abjuration is his speciality, Necromancy and Conjuration are his forbidden schools. He also has a [horse](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Light_Horse), named Adan, but he does not ride in combat.
