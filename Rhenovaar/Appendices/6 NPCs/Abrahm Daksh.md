## Description
A Brosti Special Enforcer, Abrahm Daksh dispenses with the more unruly of Brost's capital city, Centraal. Already a thankless job, Abrahm's work within the Brosti Peacekeepers often goes especially disregarded, given his half-orc lineage, which is all disregarding his discerning intellect, his keen sense of danger, and his long history cleaning the city streets of the most heinous of killers. Despite constantly being reduced to a half-orc _sword_ in the words of the remainder of the force, Abrahm exhibits a principled mind for justice and livelihood as abstract values, which he places above the petty passive-aggression of his less high-minded comrades. Only his equally ethical partner, Shepherd, appears to regard Abrahm for whom he is. But anyone who knows who's who among the denizens of Centraal know Abrahm is likely the sole reason many a Peacekeeper is still alive.

Abrahm's priorities are innocents, his partner, and lastly himself. He is quick to alert Shepherd to changes in the environment, and sternly regards strangers. Abrahm is an _excellent judge of character_.

Abrahm is always recognizable for the fact that he wears the largest suit of Enforcer armor in Centraal, and the contemplative manner in which he folds his hands on the pommel of his greatsword, whose tip often rests on the cobble streets of Centraal.
