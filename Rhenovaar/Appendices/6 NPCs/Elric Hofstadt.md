## Description

Elric Renzick Hofstadt is a former Distinguished State Mage of Brost. Before the war, Hofstadt was a renowned expert in Druidic Studies and discovered many novel methods for the arcane emulation of Druidic magics. His seminal paper, _Triticum Penumbrum: Growth of Common Wheat Under Conditions of Partial and Total Solar Umbra_, created the field of Botanical Transmutation. In it, Hofstadt describes a method for imbuing in vegetation the ability to continue growth even in conditions without sunlight, and also for the traits to be transferred to subsequent generations. As it grows at night, the resulting strain was commonly christened "Lunar Wheat", though not by Hofstadt himself (the name is actually a misnomer, as the strain grows not due to lunar illumination, but rather in the presence of a heightened ectoplasmic field made by the _absence_ of any strong illumination, when the Ethereal plane can then draw closer to the Material. In fact, Lunar Wheat grows marginally more quickly during a new moon for that exact reason). The advent of Lunar Wheat effectively doubled the yield of a single harvest.

When the war began, state-sponsored mages began to apply techniques in Botanical Transmutation towards the development of self-propagating arcane famines. E. R. Hofstadt was strongly critical of such programs, precipitating the revocation of his state accreditation. Becoming deeply disillusioned, Hofstadt abandoned society for the forests of northeastern Brost, where he lives the remainder of his life in the traditions of the Druids whose work had inspired him so long ago.

* **Druidic Knowledge**: Hofstadt is unique as spellcasters go in that he has access to Druidic spell -level equal to one less than his maximum Arcane spell-level. For the purpose of casting these spells, Hofstadt uses his Intelligence as opposed to his Wisdom modifier when determining the DC for spell saving throws. These spells are recorded in his Spellbook, and he prepares them daily as per usual for a Wizard. Unlike a Druid, Hofstadt cannot lose any prepared spell for the purposes of _Spontaneous Casting_ or to cast any _cure_ spell. Druidic spells Hofstadt knows cannot be copied from his spellbook nor can he teach them to other spellcasters without the equivalent of several years study.
* **Familiar**: Hofstadt has a hedgehog named Aldus as his familiar, which provides him a +1 Natural Armor bonus (See Hedgehog Familiar, page 203 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). 
* **School Specialization**: Hofstadt's school specialization is Transmutation; Necromancy and Evocation are his forbidden schools.

## Combat

Through the many years, the forest has become home and companion to Hofstadt, and he defends it vociferously. Though he will not hesitate to dispatch callous intruders, Hofstadt by no means lacks prudence or compassion. Hofstadt monitors the PCs from afar either by use of natural illusion and clairvoyance. He will escalate his interactions with the PCs in the following manner:

1. Demand the PCs vacate as quickly as possible through the posting of arcane signs and wards
2. Weaken the PCs (though not fatally, or permanently)
3. Steal the PCs offensive equipment
4. Confront the PCs directly

Hofstadt will combatively engage the PCs if they hunt or otherwise kill any animal in the forest. In tactics, Hofstadt will take ample time to disadvantage the PCs via snares or traps, and will also magically enhance any summoned allies by use of spells and magic items.
