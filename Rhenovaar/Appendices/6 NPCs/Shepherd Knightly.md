## Description
A Brosti Special Detective, Shepherd Knightly scours the night-beat with a penchant (or perhaps an unfortunate proclivity) for the unusual or unsavory. Having worked the graveyard shift for over nearly 8 years, it is safe to say Shepherd and his indispensable partner, Abrahm, have, to use a phrase, seen some things. Disappearings, mutilations, even ritual sacrifice in this day and age are the stuff of little surprise for Shepherd and Abrahm. Due to their immense experience protecting the populace of Brost's sprawling Centraal from threats both typical and aberrant, Shepherd Knightly is likely to be more sympathetic, although appropriately skeptical, towards the well-intentioned adventurer, certainly more so than the disassociated Brosti Military Police. To put it simply, in all things, _Shepherd needs convincing_.

Any scene sufficiently strange is likely to have Shepherd and Abrahm as visitors sooner rather than later. Shepherd himself is always recognizable by the Catchfoot tobacco pipe which he often absent-mindedly allows to extinguish, his long, wide-collared trench coat, and his wide-brimmed brown leather hat, in which he keeps a black feather from his late animal companion.

Shepherd speaks Brosti and Ogrish. For matters of a particularly arcane nature, Shepherd and Abrahm will defer to the considerable skills of Luna Klerken, diviner extraordinaire.
