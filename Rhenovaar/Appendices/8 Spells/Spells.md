Dream Scrying is a special form of [Scrying](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Scrying) in which the caster is able to view the dreams of a sleeping subject through the perspective of that subject. Normally, any sleeping subject is considered [helpless](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Helpless), however, any creature with spell resistance is able to resist Dream Scrying (DC the subject's Spell Resistance). If the subject resists the attempt to Dream Scry, they may awaken as normal.
