## Description

Brostisch is the ethnic language of the various peoples settled in the plains and forests along the Brostmeer River, in what is today The Unified Rosserdam Empire, more commonly known simply as Brost. For the purpose of Dungeon Mastering, the colloquial dialect of Brostisch (Gewoon Brostisch) has the same phonology as [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_phonology), and is generally spoken in a melodious and courteous manner, while the standard dialect of Brostisch (Standaard Brostisch or Centraaliya Brostisch), which hails from the ancestral capital of the Rosserdam Dynasty, has a phonology closer to [Viennese German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viennese_German#Phonology), and is spoken primarily in government apparatus (see also [German vs. Austrian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1Mu_e2RO1I)).
