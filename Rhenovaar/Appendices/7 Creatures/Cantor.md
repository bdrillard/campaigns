## Description

> Cantor: noun, (in formal Christian worship) a person who sings solo verses or passages to which the choir or congregation responds.
>
> Georg Cantor: mathematician and developer of set theory.

Cantors are bizarre aberrations that, by processes not well ascertained, emerge from areas soaked in particular forms of corrupting arcane energy. Although their amorphous forms can spontaneously resemble that of the incorporeal undead in that their flesh appears to undulate, shift in and out of translucence, and at times defy gravity, they are indeed composed of biological material, which is only understood insofar that they can be killed by physical means, even if their borderline hallucinatory appearance might convince one otherwise.

Cantors are more dissimilar to each other than alike, and throughout the annals of d√¶monology, virtually no entities resembling Cantors have ever been documented. The appearance of Cantors is a wholly recent, and as yet, totally confounding phenomenon.
