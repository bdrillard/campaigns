## Description

Geists are lesser [Ghosts](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ghost). While they similarly seem to possess much of the intelligence they had in their previous life, they are unique from other Ghosts in that they are bound in some way to their environment, and are unable to move beyond a certain distance from the site of their death, and they often exhibit traits in common with this environment. For example, a geist that died in a fire will likely involuntarily appear with charred skin, or even its hair aflame. Additionally, a geist requires some type of _component_, an aspect of its previous life that remains intact. This component acts as both refuge and anchor. Such components are typically the preserved corpse or intact skeleton, yet smaller, more emotionally substantive components have been known to exist.

Geists hold simpler dispositions than ghosts, often either purely malevolent, sympathetic, or indifferent, but their actions are always ritualistically patterned after their form of death. Geists possess limited control over their environments. At will they can move small to medium sized objects, they can conjure silent illusions or disembodied voices. Murderous geists use these powers to lure their prey closer to the site of their original demise, where they then seek to meet out the same fate that claimed them. When significantly threatened, a geist will retreat into the component that anchors it. If destroyed, a geist may even reconstitute itself from this component. Only destroying the component renders a geist's destruction permanent. Geists are capable of only rudimentary communication, usually limited to angry curses or phrases of warning.

One other curious aspect of geists is that they do not seem to natively inhabit the Ethereal Plane as other ghosts do. This fact was only discovered after a very serious treatment of undead and the "Schaduwsweldt" by the prolific Brostisch demonologist, Erwin Grafenheim. Later scholars have posited that geists instead are confined to "isolated purgatories", pocket dimensions having similar incorporeal qualities to the Ethereal Plane but that are otherwise "disconnected and bounded". It is currently unknown whether a proper experiment has been devised to test this hypothesis.

## Creating a Geist

"Geist" is a template that can be added to any [Human](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Human). The creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) must have a Charisma score of at least 6.

A geist loses all special abilities previously held by the base creature. All other statistics remain the same except as noted here.

* **Size and Type**: The creature’s type changes to [Undead](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Undead_Type). Do not recalculate the creature’s base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It gains the incorporeal subtype. Size is unchanged. In addition, a geist may have an [elemental type](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Elemental_Type), with the same immunities and vulnerabilities as an [Elemental](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Elemental) of the same type, and with any of its attacks having the same type as though transformed by the [Energy Substitution](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Energy_Substitution) metamagic feat. By default, a geist's attacks have the negative energy type.
* **Hit Dice**: All current and future Hit Dice become d12s.
* **Speed**: Geists have a fly speed of 30 feet, unless the base creature has a higher fly speed, with perfect maneuverability.
* **Armor Class**: When the geist manifests (see below), it gains a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier or +1, whichever is higher.
* **Damage**: A geist usually cannot deal physical damage at all but can use its special attacks, if any, when it manifests (see below).
* **[Special Attacks](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Special_Attacks_and_Special_Qualities_(Creature_Statistic))**: A geist retains none of the special attacks of the base creature. A geist instead gains one to three of the special attacks described below. The save DC against a special attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 ghost’s HD + ghost’s Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.
  * _Corrupting Touch (Su)_: A geist's touch inflicts decay and rot upon the body, dealing 1d6 points of damage on a successful touch attack. It adds its Charisma modifier to this attack. This attack has an energy type in accordance with the geist.
  * _Despairing [Gaze](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Gaze) (Su)_: A geist looks deep into the well of the soul, and once therein attempts to drink it in its entirety. Living creatures that meet the geists gaze must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. With a successful [concentration](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Concentration_Skill) check, a geist can maintain eye contact for an additional round of damage. An additional save is permitted for each successive attack. After the first successful save, the target cannot be affected by the gaze of the same geist for 24 hours.
  * _Draining Touch (Su)_: A geist's caress jealously robs its prey of vigor, dealing 1d4 points of Strength damage on a successful touch attack. It adds its Charisma modifier to this attack. This attack has an energy type in accordance with the geist.
  * _Frightful Appearance (Su)_: The strange and twisted appearance of a geist is frightening to behold. Living creatures within 60 feet that view the geist must roll a Will save as though affected by the [Cause Fear](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Cause_fear) spell. A creature that succeeds against this effect cannot be affected again by the geist's frightful appearance for 24 hours.
  * _Frightful Moan (Su)_: As _Frightful Appearance_, but a [Sonic Attack](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Sonic_Attack) as opposed to a [Gaze Attack](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Gaze).

All geists also have the following powers:
* _Manifestation (Su)_: A geist dwells in some unknown, lonely dimension, and so cannot be regularly affected by anything on the Material Plane. However, when a geist manifests, it enters the Material Plane and becomes visible, but [incorporeal](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Incorporeal). A manifested geist can only be harmed by [magic weapons](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Magic_Weapon), or by [spells](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Creature_Spells_and_Powers#Spells), with a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source. A manifested geist can pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. A manifested geist always moves silently. A manifested geist can strike with its touch attack, but with no other weapons. In its native dimension, a geist assumes a corporeal form. A geists manifests as a full-round action. A geist can be locked in the Material plane by means of [Dimensional Anchor](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Dimensional_Anchor).
* _Baleful Manifestation (Su)_: A geist with at least 7 hit dice can attempt to teleport a victim to its native demi-plane as though affected by [Plane Shift](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Plane_Shift) (Will negates). Any creature taken to the geists' demi-plane in this manner is effectively trapped unless they can escape by means of teleportation or the geist is destroyed. At that moment, the demi-plane evaporates and the prisoner is deposited back to the Material plane at a site corresponding to their location in the demi-plane.
* _Rejuvenation (Su)_: A geist cannot be destroyed easily. Any geist defeated in combat attempts a level check (1d20 + geist's HD) against DC 16. If successful, a geist will reconstitute itself above its component. The only way to assuredly destroy a geist is to destroy its component.
* _Spell-like Abilities_: At will - [Ghost Sound](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ghost_Sound), [Silent Image](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Silent_image), [Mage Hand](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Mage_hand).

Additionally:
* **Abilities**: Same as the base creature, except that a geist has no Constitution score, and its Charisma score increases by +2.
* **Skills**: Geists have a +4 racial bonus to Hide, Listen, and Spot checks. They have a number of skill points equal to the base creature, but these can only be allocated to the skills previously mentioned as though they were class skills.
* **Environment**: Any, often as base creature.
* **Organization**: Always solitary.
* **Challenge Rating**: Same as the base creature +2.
* **Treasure**: None.
* **Alignment**: Any.
