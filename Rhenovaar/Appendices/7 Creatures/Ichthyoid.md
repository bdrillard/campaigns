## Description

> The sound of heaving and wet footsteps herald the arrival of these grotesque twistings of human and sickly piscine forms. Tattered cloths hang off bony fins and expose patches of cracked and oozing scales over necrophying flesh. On one, the eyes dominate most of the face, glassy and vacant, on another, a maw of multiple rows of serrated teeth gasps as though suffocating. Fins protrude from lacerations bleeding black ichor from the back and limbs. Each monstrosity is more unimaginable than the last.

An Icthyoid has never been documented by any known d√¶monologist. There manifestation is an apparently spontaneous phenomenon having its epicenter as Drekstaal, a fishing town upriver from Centraal, Brost. Their form is essentially humanoid, but dominated with the features of a sickened fish at random: bulbous, wet eyes; fins or spines along the back and limbs; a mouth with rows of serrated teeth; oily scales; even pink, oozing gills.

The creatures are apparently sentient, being able to communicate in a given subject's previous language, but Icthyoids are typically only be able to regurgitate common phrases, with more nuanced conversation susceptible to non-sequiturs.

With great strain, an Icthyoid can contort its physical form back into that of its subject (see [Combat](#combat) below). Their apparent aim is to infiltrate and propagate, beyond that, their goals are otherwise unknown.

## Combat

Due to their frail frames, Icthyoids prefer divide and conquer tactics, or the use of overwhelming numbers.

**Special Attacks**: Every Icthyoid has a 1/3 chance of possessing a special attack as noted below
* _Bile_: Once per day, an Icthyoid can explosively regurgitate the contents of its stomach. On a successful touch attack the target takes 1d3 points of acid damage and must succeed in a Fortitude save DC 14, or become [Nauseated](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Nauseated).
* _Tentacle_: As simply another aspect of its bizarre form, some Icthyoids possess tentacles at random locations of their bodies. On a successful attack (+4), an Icthyoid deals 1 point of damage, and the target must succeed in a Fortitude save DC 12 or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Elves have immunity to this paralysis.

**Spell-like Abilities (Su)**: An Icthyoid may cast [Disguise Self](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Disguise_Self) at will except the casting time is a [Full-round action](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Full-round_action). Creatures do not get an opportunity to recognize the power as an illusion.
