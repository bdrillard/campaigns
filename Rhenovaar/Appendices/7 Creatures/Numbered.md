## Description

A creature affected by the corrupting energies of a Number Station are referred to as _Numbered_. Their bodies twisted, and their minds polluted, they wander the landscape in constant, agonizing pain, their only instincts having been reduced to an incorrigible desire to feed. Their appearance is grizzly and bizarre. Numbered animals will adopt uncharacteristic behaviours, including incessant and unprovoked baying, clicking, howling, or shrieking or in some instances, even bipedal locomotion. Their bodies may have become so misshapen that their organs and bones are exposed through split flesh, infected, oozing blood and pus, yet they are unnaturally resilient, their lifeforce being apparently infused with an unspeakable malice and will to persist.

## Creating a Numbered

"Numbered" is a template that can be added to any [Animal](http://dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Animal). The creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) must have a Constitution score of at least 10.

A Numbered retains all extraordinary (Ex) abilities and feats previously held by the base creature. All other statistics remain the same except as noted here.

* **Size and Type**: The creature's type changes to [Aberration](http://dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Aberration). Size is unchanged.
* **Attack and Full Attack**: A Numbered creature gains 2 claws and a bite if it did not previously possess the attacks.
* **Special Attacks**: A Numbered gains the following special attack:
    * _Disturbing Vocalizations (Su)_: A Numbered creature announces its presence with distressing howls and clicks, even ones which may have been previously physically impossible for the creature. Infrequently, these sounds even ebb into the domain of human utterances, striking the listener as uncannily close to maddened cackling. Every round, any creature within audible range must make a Will save (DC 10 + Numbered's HD), or be [shaken](http://dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Shaken) for 1d4 rounds. Any creature who succeeds against this attack is subsequently immune to the attack when from the same Numbered.
* **Special Qualities**: A Numbered gains Darkvision (60 ft.) if the base creature did not previously have it.
* **Feats**: Despite its tortured form, a Numbered is unnaturally quick, vicious, and resilient. It gains _Improved Initiative_, _Weapon Focus (Bite)_, and _Improved Natural Armor_.
* **Challenge Rating**: Same as the base creature +1.
* **Treasure**: None.
* **Alignment**: Always Chaotic Evil.
