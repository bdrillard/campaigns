## Description

Throughout the history of magic, the act of healing has been the domain of the divine and the druidic, that is, until the advent of Chirurgery. Shortages of front-line Clerics in every human nation over the years of the Continental War have necessitated substantial, yet nascient, developments in the application of non-divine magics to the healing of wounds.

A Chirurgeon is an Arcane spell-caster who applies their dual knowledge of physiology and conjuration as a healer, and through their skill, replace or even supplant the Cleric, Paladin, or Druid as the sole source of healing magic. 

**Hit Die**: d4.

## Requirements

To qualify to become a Chirurgeon, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

* **Skills**: Concentration 5 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, Heal 5 ranks, Spellcraft 10 ranks
* **Feats**: Spell Focus (Conjuration)
* **Spells**: Able to cast 3rd-level conjuration spells.

## Class Skills

A Chirurgeon's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Heal (Wis), Knowlege (any) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis)

## Class Features

All the following are the class features of the Chirurgeon prestige class.

* **Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Chirurgeons gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
* **Chirurgery**: A Chirurgeon's knowledge of the humanoid body allows them to apply conjuration to call forth new bone and flesh. Starting at 1st level, they gain access to all "cure" spells as listed in the [Cleric Spell List](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Cleric_Spell_List) of a level equal to or lower than their current Arcane caster level (a _cure_ spell is any spell with "cure" in its name). As a cleric, a Chirurgeon has access to prepare these spells, even if the caster does not have them in a spellbook. Each cure spell is as listed except noted:
    * **Components**: V, S, M
    * **Material components**: a pinch of powdered flesh and bone, a vial of blood belonging to the race of the spell subject.
    * **Special**: the caster must additionally prepare the site to cure. This requires performing a heal check (DC 15) taking a number of minutes equal to the spell level.
* **Combat Chirurgery**: At 3rd level and higher, a Chirurgeon can substitute any prepared Conjuration spell for a Cure spell of level equal to or lower than the prepared spell as though they had the _Spontaneous Casting_ ability of a good Cleric.
* **Adept Chirurgery**: At 7th level and higher, a Chirurgeon's intimate experience in preparing the wounds of their subjects allows them to subsume the heal check into the actual heal spell.
* **Expanded Chirurgery**: At 9th level and higher, a Chirurgeon's knowledge of physiology is so advanced, and their skill in Conjuration so precise, that they can cast any spell of the [Healing Subschool](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Healing_Subschool) except Resurrection, True Resurrection, and Raise Dead, and any spell not having a single target. As a cleric, a Chirurgeon has access to prepare these spells, even if the caster does not have them in a spellbook.
